    <p>A photo gallery is a collection of images organized and displayed together, often on a website, app, or in a physical space like a museum or photo album. In digital form, it allows users to browse through photos, view them in larger sizes, and sometimes interact with them by liking, sharing, or commenting. The photos in a gallery are usually arranged in grids or slideshows, making it easy to navigate and enjoy the visual content.</p>
